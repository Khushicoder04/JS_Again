javaScript execution Context

{}--> global ec <-- this(var)
global execution Context
function execution Context
eval execution code

box is there in which we have js code {}
it will run in two phase 
memory creation phase
execution phase

let see one code 

let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5
function addNum(num1, num2){
    let tot = num1 + num2
    return tot
}
let res1 = addNum(val1, val2)
let res2 = addNum(10, 2);

step:
1. global execution locte in this
2. memory phase in this collect allthe var and just put here
       val1 --> undefined
       val2 --> undefined
       addnum --> definition
       res1 --> undefined
       res2 --> undefined

3. execution phase
   val1 <-- 10
   val2 <-- 5
   adnum ---> this will create another executionl Context
                new environment + execution thread
                again in this memory phase and execution phase will 
                occur for addnum.
                1. memory phase
                val1 --> undefined
                val2 -->undefined
                tot --> undefined
                2. execution Context
                num1-->10
                num2-->5
                tot-->15

call stack  --> lifo conceft
